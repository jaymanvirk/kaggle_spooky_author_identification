# Spooky Author Identification: Fine-tuning Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVM and XGBoost

## Abstract
In this study we explore the fine-tuning of various machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and XGBoost, for the task of author classification based on short textual excerpts. Our objective is to identify the optimal configurations that minimize logloss.

All the experiments conducted in this study were based on the dataset comprising text from works of fiction written by renowned authors of the public domain: Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft and Mary Shelley. Every algorithm undergoes fine-tuning via grid search and cross-validation within limited computational resources, ensuring a detailed exploration of the hyperparameter space.
